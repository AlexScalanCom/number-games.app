## Game Modes

Number Games offers **two ways** to play — pick your challenge:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 🕐 **Classic** | No time limit. Play at your own pace until no valid moves remain | Relaxed, strategic play |
| ⏱️ **5-Min Timer** | You have exactly 5 minutes to rack up as many points as possible | Fast-paced, high-score chasing |

Both modes share the same scoring rules and board mechanics — only the pressure differs. Your scores are tracked **separately** for each mode, so you can compete against yourself in both styles.

### Tips by Mode

- **Classic** — take your time, plan multi-chain setups, and hunt for long combos
- **5-Min Timer** — speed matters! grab quick pairs when stuck, don't overthink chains, and watch the clock

## How to Play

### The Basics

1. **Drag** your finger (mobile) or mouse across adjacent tiles on the board
2. Connect **2 to 7 tiles** in a chain — only up, down, left, right (no diagonals)
3. When you release, the values of all selected tiles are added together
4. If the sum is **divisible by 10**, the chain is valid — tiles disappear and you score points

### Examples

| Chain | Sum | Result |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| 3 → 7 | 10 | ✅ Valid |
| 6 → 4 | 10 | ✅ Valid |
| 3 → 7 → 4 → 6 | 20 | ✅ Valid |
| 5 → 5 → 5 → 5 | 20 | ✅ Valid |
| 3 → 5 | 8 | ❌ Invalid |
| 7 → 4 | 11 | ❌ Invalid |

### Scoring

Your score is calculated from four factors:

- **Chain Sum** — the total of all connected tile values
- **Chain Length** — longer chains earn bigger multipliers
- **Special Tiles** — some tiles carry a ×2, ×3, or ×5 bonus; the highest one in your chain is applied
- **Combo Multiplier** — consecutive valid chains stack up a combo

```
Score = Chain Sum × Length Multiplier × Special Multiplier × Combo Multiplier
```

#### Length Multipliers

| Tiles Connected | Multiplier |
|:---:|:---:|
| 2 | ×1 |
| 3 | ×2 |
| 4 | ×3 |
| 5 | ×5 |
| 6 | ×8 |
| 7+ | ×12 → ×15 |

#### Combo System

Your combo grows based on the total chains you've completed — failed chains do **not** reset it. Build longer chains to level up faster:

```
Combo Level = floor((5+chains × 6 + 4-chains × 3 + 3-chains × 2 + 2-chains) / 30)
Combo Multiplier = Combo Level + 1
```

### Board Mechanics

After a valid chain:

- Selected tiles **disappear** with a smooth animation
- Remaining tiles **fall down** to fill empty spaces
- **New tiles** appear at the top — watch for special bonus tiles!
- Your score updates instantly

The game ends when no valid move remains on the board, or you can press **Finish** early to lock in your score.

## Tips & Strategy

🎯 **Spot pairs first** — 1+9, 2+8, 3+7, 4+6, 5+5 all add to 10 — these are reliable starting moves

🔗 **Chain longer when possible** — a 5-tile chain scores far more than two separate pairs

⭐ **Hunt the special tiles** — bonus multipliers can triple your score on a single chain

📐 **Plan ahead** — watch how tiles fall after each move; some chains set up better future moves

⏱️ **Play to win, not to stall** — pressing Finish early locks in your score before the board runs out of moves
